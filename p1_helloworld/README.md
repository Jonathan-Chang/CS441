This is a simple Hello World application that was written using Swift. The app utilizes the MapKit View that's provided by XCode. When the app is first opened, the default region is set to Binghamton University. The "Hello World" is a button that when pressed, it transitions to a different country and the "Hello World" text gets translated to the language that corresponds with the country. Annotations are used to put the red marker on the location. The countries are fixed so it will loop through the same countries with every press. The idea came from the phrase itself and I just wanted to incorporate the world in the app.
