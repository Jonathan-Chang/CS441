This is a simple animation game where Iron Man has to shoot his lasers at aliens.
I used Swift and SpriteKit to build this. Enemies will spawn randomly from the top of the screen and Iron Man has to destroy them or risk losing a life.
When the player runs out of lives, the game will completely stop. There is also a score counter to keep track of how many aliens you've killed.
With the built in PhysicsBody it was possible to perform certain actions when objects collide which was pretty cool. I could've added a main menu and other features, but maybe that's for later.
